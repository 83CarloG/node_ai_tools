# node_ai_tools

**node_ai_tools** is a demonstration application built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** to showcase how to integrate **OpenAPI** calls while leveraging multiple external services—perfect for testing "tools" in a Large Language Model (LLM) context.

## Features

1. **Reddit Scraping**  
   Fetches the latest posts from a specific Reddit channel.

2. **Image Generation**  
   Utilizes a text prompt to generate personalized images.

3. **Dad Joke API**  
   Calls an external API to fetch “dad jokes,” adding a playful element to the user experience.

> **Purpose:**  
> This project provides a test environment for exploring how an LLM’s "tools" can interact with external APIs (e.g., Reddit, image generation, Dad Joke API) within a single Node/TypeScript application.

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
